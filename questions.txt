q1. 1. Define an `Author` struct with two fields:
        - `Name` (string)
        - `Books` (slice of strings)

    2. Create two methods for the `Author` struct:
        - One method to add new books to the books slice
        - Another method to display/print the author information

    3. Write a function that takes an `Author` struct as a parameter and adds books to
     its books slice
    4. Write another function that takes just the `Books` slice (not the entire struct)
     as a parameter and appends additional books to it
